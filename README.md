# Pomorodo Timer
A private project in SolidJS to run my own pomorodo timer with rewards. Allows you to set a prize at the end and get stickers for each block you finish. Editable time length.

**ONLY WORKS IN FIREFOX AS OF 06/06/2025** Uses the Temporal API, wonderful thing. Only supported in FF as of right now.

This is just a hobby project and thus it is:
- Scrappy
- Committing many sins
- Beautiful

## To Run
- Have node installed. (Node v23.6.1 (npm 10.9.2)) is what I'm using.
- Run `npm start`

## To contribute
- Don't. Fork it and create your own beautiful monster.
